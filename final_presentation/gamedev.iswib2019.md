## Words of thanks
My big thanks go to:

## Demo 1 - Synthwave space shooter
- To cover basics od 2D in Unity we created a space shooter game
- Player is controlling a spaceship at bottom part of the screen
- Enemies are attacking from the top of the screen
- There are 3 types of enemies:
    - Simple enemy who only moves down
    - Enemy that can shoot at the player
    - And an enemy that also has horizontal movement
