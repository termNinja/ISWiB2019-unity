# Day 01 - Introduction to (Object Oriented) Programming

## Language C\#
- Developed by Microsoft
- A general purpose multi-paradigm programming language
- Used by Unity engine
- Has syntax inspired by C, C++ and Java
- Will be very familiar to you if you've done some C, C++ or Java before

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{images/csharp}
\end{center}

## Language C\#

```c#
using System;
namespace HelloWorld
{
    class Hello 
    {
        public static void Main() 
        {
            // This is a comment
            Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
        }
    }
}
```

## Statements
- Statements are commands that the programmer issues
- Computer executes the statements and produces some result
- It's important that we are very precise - because computer is a machine
- In real world, statements would be something like:
    - `turn aroud`
    - `get up`
    - `start running`
    - `turn off the light`
- In C\#, a statement is **terminated** by a semicolon `;`

## Statements
```c#
using System;
namespace HelloWorld
{
    class Hello 
    {
        public static void Main() 
        {
            int x = 10;                 // statement 1
            int y = 20;                 // statement 2 
            Console.WriteLine(x + y);   // statement 3
        }
    }
}
```

## Types
- Language C\# is a **typed** language
- This means that every variable we create needs to have a **type**
```c#
    // Wrong! What is the type of x?
    x = 5

    // Correct! Type of x is Integer
    int x = 5;
```

## Types
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.46]{images/types}
\end{center}

## Types
- We also call the previously shown types with the name **primitive types**
- Why? They are **primitive** :)
- They don't represent anything complex or composite
- From primitive types, in Unity we will be mostly be using `bool`, `char`, `int` and `float`
- There are also more complex types that we represent with **classes**
- We will get to that a bit later - but it's the **main topic** of the object oriented programming

## Variables
- With variables we wish to **store** some information at some convenient place
- We also wish to be able to **retrieve** that information when needed
- Variables have a **name** and a **type**
- A **type** is what we've seen before - for example `int`
- A **name** is the name of the variable - for example `x`
```c#
    int x = 10;
    int y;
    float z = 3.1f;
    char w = 'a';
```

## Variables - exercise

### Task 01
Write a program that creates variables `x` and `y` with values `10` and `20`.
Write out the values `x*y`, `x+y`, `x-y` and `x/y`.

## If statement
- What if we wish to do **something** depending on a **certain condition**?
    - Close the door **if** it's cold, **otherwise** do nothing?
    - **If** today is Tuesday then learn C\#, **otherwise** have fun
- We can accomplish this using the **if statement**

## If statement

```c#
static void Main(string[] args)
{
    int x = 4;
    bool even = x % 2 == 0;
    if (even)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Number is even!");
    }
    else
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Number is not even!");
    }
}
```

## If statement - multiple branches
- We can also allow if to have multiple branches
- How much? It's up to you.

```c#
    if (CONDITIION 1) STATEMENT 1
    else if (CONDITIION 2) STATEMENT 2
    else if (CONDITIION 2) STATEMENT 2
    else if (CONDITIION 3) STATEMENT 3
    ...
    else if (CONDITIION N) STATEMENT N
    else STATEMENT N+1
```

## Loops
- Loops are a mechanism that allows us to execute a block of statements **multiple times**
- If you wanted to write `Hello` 10 times to standard output, how would you do it?

## Loops

```c#
    Console.WriteLine("Hello");
    Console.WriteLine("Hello");
    Console.WriteLine("Hello");
    Console.WriteLine("Hello");
    Console.WriteLine("Hello");
    Console.WriteLine("Hello");
    Console.WriteLine("Hello");
    Console.WriteLine("Hello");
    Console.WriteLine("Hello");
    Console.WriteLine("Hello");
```

## Loops
Or maybe this?

```c#
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Hello");
}
```

## Loops - for loop

```c#
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello");
    }
```

- At the start, variable `i` is `0`
- Then code inside the block is executed
- Then `i` is incremented (value increased by 1)
- Then `i` is checked against the condition `i < 10`, it's true as `i = 1`
- So next **iteration** happens and code inside the block is executed
- Then `i` is incremented (value increased by 1)
- Then `i` is checked against the condition `i < 10`, it's true as `i = 2`
- So next **iteration** happens and code inside the block is executed

## Loops - for loop
- We keep on going until...
- Then code inside the block is executed
- Then `i` is incremented (value increased by 1)
- Then `i` is checked against the condition `i < 10`, it's true as `i = 9`
- Then code inside the block is executed
- Then `i` is incremented (value increased by 1)
- Then `i` is checked against the condition `i < 10`, it's false as `i = 10`
- The loop stops and program continues after the loop

## Loops - while loop

```c#
    i = 0;
    while (i < 0)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello");
        i++;
    }
```
- A **while** loop is a bit different and simpler
- It keeps on executing until the **condition** is true
- Usually it's used when we **don't know** the amount of required iterations
- Does the code above remind you of something?

## Functions
- Functions are a basic building block of our programs
- Function is a block of code that we give a name to
- Ignore the word `static` for now

```c#
    static int Add(int a, int b)
    {
        return a + b;
    }
    static void ShowFirst(int n)
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(i+1);
        }
    }
```

## Functions
- It's very good to break our code into multiple functions
- As program grows we break it down into multiple files also
- But how do we describe complicated things with these simple constructs?
- Using Object Oriented Programming, it's much easier to do it! Let's check it out!

# Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

## The OOP
- So far we have learned about types like `int`, `float` and similar
- We also mentioned that we can construct more complex types. How?
- By constructing a **class**!

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.25]{./images/object}
\end{center}

## Classes and objects
- A class is a template that **describes** an **object**
- A class defines:
    - Attributes (we also call them properties)
    - Methods (they are basically functions)
- A **attribute** is some data that the object contains
- A **method** is a function that can get invoked on an object

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.21]{./images/object}
\end{center}

## The OOP
- We use classes to create templates for the objects that exist in *our world*
- For example, if we are creating:
    - music program - classes are `Song`, `Artist`, `Album`, `Playlist`...
    - video game - classes are `Player`, `Enemy`, `NPC`, `Tree`, `Ball`...
- Objects are concrete examples of a class, we also call them **instances**
- Our program is an **interaction of objects**
- This is similar to real world actually!

## Class - constructor
- A Class has a **constructor** (shorthand is `ctor`)
- A constructor is a **special function** that allows us to **instantiate** an object

```c#
    public class Point {
        // Class attributes
        private float x, y;

        // Constructor (ctor)
        public Point(float someX, float someY)
        {
            x = someX;
            y = someY;
        }
    }
```

## Class - constructor
- How do we instantiate an object?
- We use the keyword `new`
- This invokes the constructor from the class

```c#
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Point p = new Point(2.3f, 4.1f);
        Console.WriteLine(p);
    }
```

## Class - methods
- Methods are services that an object gives us to use
- For example, we can ask a point to move in 2D space

```c#
    public class Point {
        private float x, y;
        public Point(float someX, float someY) {
            x = someX;
            y = someY;
        }
        public void translate(float dx, float dy) {
            x += dx;    // update x by vector dx
            y += dy;    // update y by vector dy
        }
    }
```

## Class - methods
- Please do note that we **call** a method **on an object**!

```c#
    Point p = new Point(1.0f, 2.0f);
    p.translate(3f, 4f);
    // NOT! translate(p, 3f, 4f) or translate(3f, 4f)...
```

## Class - visibility specifiers
- So far you've probably noticed things like `private` and `public`
- What are they?
- They are only used for things that are class related
- They handle the problem of **visibility** of a function, class or variable
- If something is `private`, then we can't see it outside of its scope
- If something is `public`, then everyone can see it

## Class - visibility specifiers
- Outside of class `Point`, you **can't** see variables `x` and `y`!

```c#
    public class Point {
        // Class attributes
        private float x, y;

        // Constructor (ctor)
        public Point(float someX, float someY)
        {
            x = someX;
            y = someY;
        }
    }
```

## C\# Coding Standards
 
### Variables:
- Variable names should start with lowercase
- If a name is formed of multiple words, use camelcase notation

### Functions:
- Function name should start with a Capital case letter
- If a name is formed of multiple words, use camelcase notation
- Same for class methods

### Class attributes:
- Name should be prefixed with an underscore _
- If a name is formed of multiple words, use camelcase notation

## Live Coding
- Let's implement a small example for a video game

# OOP - Advanced concepts

## The Pillars of OOP
- The three main pillars of OOP are:
    - Encapsulation
    - Polymorphism
    - Inheritance

## Encapsulation
\begin{center}
    \theimage{./images/iceberg01}
\end{center}

## Encapsulation
\begin{center}
    \theimage{./images/iceberg02}
\end{center}

## Encapsulation
- Sometimes, we only see the *tip of the iceberg*
- And also, lots of times, we only **wish** to see the *tip*
- It makes using libraries and foreign code **much easier**

*Encapsulation is a principle by which we wish to hide internal logic from the outside world*.

- It's acomplished by:
    - Showing a *public interface* to the user (exposed via `public`)
    - And hiding internal logic (hidden via `private`)

## Inheritance

## Polymorphism
